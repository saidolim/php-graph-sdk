In reply to: How do I post to Facebook from my website?
I found an example on the Facebook site that I can use to solve my problem. For the benefit of others that might want to do the same thing, I'll explain what I did. First I got the example included with the PHP SDK to work, then I added an example that posts a message to Facebook to the SDK example folder. Perhaps someone looking to drive traffic to their site can expand upon my instructions and create a quality tutorial. Here are the details:


Example from the SDK(simple connect)
============================= 
1. Download the zip file with the PHP SDK, including the examples
- https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk
2. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/
3. Select "Apps | Create a New App" from the top menu
4. Enter a Display Name and select a category(I chose "Apps for Pages" but I don't know if it matters).
5. Click create App and get click through the captch form.
6. Click settings on the left side menu
7. Click "+ Add Platform" and select "Website"
8. For the "Site URL", enter the of for the folder containing the example
9. Get the App ID and App Secret at the top portion of the page and enter it into the example program.
10. Test the example to make sure it works

Example that posts a message(and link) to Facebook
=======================================
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/howto/postwithgraphapi
2. Create post_links.php(call it whatever you want) in the same directory as example.php 
3. Enter the App ID and App Secret(same as for example.php) into post_links.php
4. In example.php, change require_once('../src/facebook.php'); to require_once('php-sdk/facebook.php');
5. Upload and test

Thank you Sovereign for your help, much appreciated.
